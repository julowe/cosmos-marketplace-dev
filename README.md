# Marketplace for Cosmos

This repo is a marketplace for Cosmos ServApps.
It will be for testing or maybe also my own ServApps.

## How to use

Go to Market in Cosmos UI, and then click 'Sources'.
Add the url `https://julowe.github.io/cosmos-marketplace`
to the sources list and save it.

Or is it `https://julowe.github.io/cosmos-marketplace/servapps.json`?
